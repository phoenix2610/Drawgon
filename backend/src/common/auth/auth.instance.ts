/**
 * In development the frontend (localhost:5173) and API (localhost:3000) are
 * the same site, so the default `SameSite=Lax` session cookie is sent freely.
 * Deployed they are not: the frontend sits on Netlify and the API on its own
 * host, which makes every auth request cross-site. Browsers drop a `Lax`
 * cookie there, so login appears to succeed and the very next request arrives
 * anonymous — bouncing the user straight back to /login.
 *
 * `SameSite=None` requires `Secure`, which requires HTTPS. That combination is
 * only correct in production; forcing it locally would stop the cookie from
 * being stored over plain http at all.
